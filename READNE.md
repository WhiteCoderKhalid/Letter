Project: Valentine's Envelope Animation
Overview
This project is a creative Valentine's-themed animation using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The animation features a card inside an envelope that pops up when hovered and floats back after a delay. Additionally, there are floating heart animations and a shadow effect beneath the envelope for added visual appeal.

Features
Envelope with Card Animation:

The card inside the envelope rises when the container is hovered and returns after 5 seconds.
Floating Hearts:

Multiple small hearts animate upwards, scaling and fading as they rise, simulating a romantic effect.
Responsive Design:

The design adjusts for different screen sizes, including tablets and phones, with media queries for optimal viewing on various devices.
Shadow Animation:

A soft shadow animation under the envelope, scaling horizontally to mimic a floating effect.
Files
index.html: Contains the HTML structure.
style.css: Contains the styling for the envelope, card, hearts, and other elements.
script.js: Contains the jQuery logic for the hover animation and interaction effects.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the envelope, card, hearts, and container.
CSS: Styling of the envelope, card, hearts, and shadow. CSS keyframes are used to animate the hearts and shadow.
jQuery: Handles the interactive elements of the animation, such as hover events and timed animations.
Code Breakdown
1. HTML Structure
The HTML structure consists of a container holding an envelope, which in turn contains the animated card. It also includes floating hearts.

2. CSS Styling and Animation
Container: Positioned at the center of the screen using Flexbox.
Envelope: Styled with CSS shapes and positioned relative to the card.
Card: Positioned inside the envelope and animates upwards when hovered using jQuery.
Hearts: Small heart elements that animate upwards and scale with a custom @keyframes rule.
Shadow: A subtle shadow animation that scales to give the envelope a floating effect.
3. javascript => (HOWIT WORK)
On hover (mouseenter), the card animates upwards by 90px.
On mouse leave (mouseleave), after a 5-second delay, the card returns to its original position.
The stop() method ensures that the animation queue is cleared, preventing stacking of animations on multiple hover events.
 
 4. Usage
Clone or download the project repository.
Open index.html in a browser to view the animation.
Hover over the envelope to trigger the card animation.
Resize the browser window to see the responsive design in action.
